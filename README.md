# Uncommon Python Bug: Silent Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python related to division by zero that doesn't immediately raise an exception. The code seems to handle zero cases, but an edge case leads to unexpected results.

The `bug.py` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling, particularly when dealing with potential division by zero scenarios.
